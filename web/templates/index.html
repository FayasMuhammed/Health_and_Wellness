                <p>The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy needed while resting in a temperate
                    environment when the digestive system is inactive. It is the equivalent of figuring out how much
                    gas an idle car consumes while parked. In such a state, energy will be used only to maintain
                    vital organs, which include the heart, brain, kidneys, nervous system, intestines, liver, lungs,
                    sex organs, muscles, and skin. For most people, upwards of ~70% of total energy (calories)
                    burned each day is due to upkeep. Physical activity makes up ~20% of expenditure and ~10% is
                    used for the digestion of food, also known as thermogenesis.</p>

                <p>The BMR is measured under very restrictive circumstances while awake. An accurate BMR
                    measurement requires that a person's sympathetic nervous system is inactive, which means the
                    person must be completely rested. Basal metabolism is usually the largest component of a
                    person's total caloric needs. The daily caloric need is the BMR value multiplied by a factor
                    with a value between 1.2 and 1.9, depending on activity level.</p>
                <p>In most situations, the BMR is estimated with equations summarized from statistical data. The
                    Harris-Benedict Equation was one of the earliest equations introduced. It was revised in 1984 to
                    be more accurate and was used up until 1990, when the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation was introduced.
                    The Mifflin-St Jeor Equation has been shown to be more accurate than the revised Harris-Benedict
                    Equation. The Katch-McArdle Formula is slightly different in that it calculates resting daily
                    energy expenditure (RDEE), which takes lean body mass into account, something that neither the
                    Mifflin-St Jeor nor the Harris-Benedict Equation does. Of these equations, the Mifflin-St Jeor
                    Equation is considered the most accurate equation for calculating BMR with the exception that
                    the Katch-McArdle Formula can be more accurate for people who are leaner and know their body fat
                    percentage. You can pick the equation to be used in the calculation by expanding the settings.</p>

                <h3>BMR Variables</h3>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Muscle Mass</span> â€“ Aerobic exercises, such as running or cycling,
                    have no effect on BMR. However,
                    anaerobic exercises, such as weight-lifting, indirectly lead to a higher BMR because they build
                    muscle mass, increasing resting energy consumption. The more muscle mass in the physical
                    composition of an individual, the higher the BMR required to sustain their body at a certain
                    level.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Age</span> â€“ The more elderly and limber an individual, the lower
                    their BMR, or the lower the minimum
                    caloric intake required to sustain the functioning of their organs at a certain level.</p>

                <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Genetics</span> â€“ Hereditary traits passed down from ancestors
                    influence BMR.</p>

                <p><span>Weather</span> â€“ Cold environments raise BMR because of the energy required to create a
                    homeostatic
                    body temperature. Likewise, too much external heat can raise BMR as the body expends energy to
                    cool off internal organs. BMR increases approximately 7% for every increase of 1.36 degrees
                    Fahrenheit in the body's internal temperature.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Diet</span> â€“ Small, routinely dispersed meals increase BMR. On the
                    other hand, starvation can reduce
                    BMR by as much as 30%. Similar to a phone that goes into power-saving mode during the last 5% of
                    its battery, a human body will make sacrifices such as energy levels, moods, upkeep of bodily
                    physique, and brain functions in order to more efficiently utilize what little caloric energy is
                    being used to sustain it.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pregnancy</span> â€“ Ensuring the livelihood of a separate fetus
                    internally increases BMR. This is why
                    pregnant women tend to eat more than usual. Also, menopause can increase or decrease BMR
                    depending on hormonal changes.</p>

                <p><span>Supplements</span> â€“ Certain supplements or drugs raise BMR, mostly to fuel weight loss.
                    Caffeine is a
                    common one.</p>

                <h3>BMR Tests</h3>
                <p>Online BMR tests with rigid formulas are not the most accurate method of determining an
                    individual's BMR. It is better to consult a certified specialist or measure BMR through a
                    calorimetry device. These handheld devices are available in many health and fitness clubs,
                    doctor offices, and weight-loss clinics.</p>

                <p>Resting Metabolic Rate
                    While the two are used interchangeably, there is a key difference in their definitions. Resting
                    metabolic rate, or RMR for short, is the rate at which the body burns energy in a relaxed, but
                    not fully inactive state. It is also sometimes defined as resting energy expenditure, or REE.
                    BMR measurements must meet total physiological equilibrium while RMR conditions of measurement
                    can be altered and defined by contextual limitations.</p>

                <h3>Modern Wisdom</h3>
                <p>A 2005 meta-analysis study on BMR* showed that when controlling all factors of metabolic rate,
                    there is still a 26% unknown variance between people. Essentially, an average person eating an
                    average diet will likely have expected BMR values, but there are factors that are still not
                    understood that determines BMR precisely.</p>

                <p>Therefore, all BMR calculations, even using the most precise methods through specialists, will
                    not be perfectly accurate in their measurements. Not all human bodily functions are well
                    understood just yet, so calculating total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) derived from BMR
                    estimates are just that, estimates. When working towards any sort of health or fitness goal, BMR
                    can aid in laying down the foundations, but from there on, it has little else to offer. A
                    calculated BMR and thus TDEE may result in unsatisfactory results because of their rough
                    estimates, but maintaining a daily journal of exercise, food consumption, etc., can help track
                    the factors that lead to any given results and help determine what works, as well as what needs
                    to be improved upon. Tracking progress in said journal and making adjustments over time as
                    needed is generally the best indication of progress towards reaching personal goals.</p>
